# WiFi-Controlled-Office-Automation
In this project, the main input will be given by us in the form of a speech signal or through the app. In order to process this speech signal which is primarily mechanical i.e. sound, we have developed an application. This application converts the mechanical sound waves into electrically processible signals. It will be converted to a text format which is then sent to the raspberry pi using a Wi-Fi module. The raspberry pi acts as the bridge between the signal processing side and the physical output generation i.e. controlling the working of lights and fans. Then finally a relay module is used to control the outputs from the lights and fans. We are also displaying the temperature and humidity of the room in the app using the DHT sensor.
